To do list:
* learn to use github:
 * make changes on local computer
 * `git status` to see which files have changed
 * `git add <files>`
 * `git commit -m 'message about what you did'
 * `git push` sends it to github
 * `git pull` grabs from github (always good to do before you start working)
 * Other useful commands are:
  * `git log` to see what happend
  * `git diff` to compare different versions of files
